A throwaway email is a temporary or disposable email address used briefly and then discarded. It serves as a shield for users' primary email addresses, protecting them from potential spam or unwanted messages when signing up for websites or services.

However, from the perspective of website owners or administrators, throwaway emails can present some challenges and drawbacks:

1. **Fake Accounts:** Users may exploit throwaway emails to create multiple fake accounts on a website. This can be problematic for websites that aim to maintain a genuine user base and accurately track user engagement.

2. **Verification Issues:** Some websites require email verification to ensure the authenticity of user accounts. When users use throwaway emails, they might not complete the verification process, leading to incomplete or unreliable user data.

3. **Communication Difficulties:** If website administrators need to contact users regarding their accounts or important updates, sending emails to throwaway addresses becomes futile as they are short-lived and may no longer be active.

4. **Bypassing Restrictions:** Websites often impose limitations on activities such as content submissions or downloads to prevent abuse. Users might exploit throwaway emails to bypass these restrictions and engage in undesired behaviors.

5. **Reduced Engagement:** Since throwaway emails are temporary, users may not actively engage with the website over the long term. This could result in lower user retention and less meaningful interactions.

To address the issues associated with throwaway emails, you can enable the throwaway config option on the dashboard.
