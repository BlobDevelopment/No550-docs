A suspicious domain refers to a website address (URL) that appears dubious or questionable due to certain characteristics that deviate from typical and legitimate domain patterns. These domains often raise concerns about their legitimacy and may be associated with malicious activities or scams. Several factors can make a domain appear suspicious, and some of them include:

1. **Weird Characters and Strange Order**: Suspicious domains might contain unusual characters, random strings of letters or numbers, or use a non-standard order of characters that do not follow the conventional structure of domain names. For example, a domain like "fj3k9l2a1.com" would be considered suspicious due to the random combination of characters.

2. **Misspellings and Typosquatting**: Cybercriminals often create domains that closely resemble popular legitimate websites by intentionally misspelling the original domain. This technique, known as "typosquatting," aims to deceive users into thinking they are accessing a legitimate site, but they end up on a malicious page. For instance, a suspicious domain might look like "goggle.com" instead of "google.com."

3. **Phishing Keywords**: Suspicious domains often include words like "login," "banking," "password," or "verify," attempting to trick users into divulging sensitive information through phishing attacks.

4. **Government or Top Domains Impersonation**: In some cases, malicious actors might create domains that appear to be associated with a government entity or a well-known top domain to gain users' trust. For instance, a domain like "governmentofficials.gov" could be suspicious if it is not an official government site.
