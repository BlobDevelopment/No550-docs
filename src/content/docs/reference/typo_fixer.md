When composing an email, it's common for users to make mistakes while entering the recipient's email address, which can lead to failed delivery or misdirected emails.

The email typo fixer helps address this problem by implementing algorithms that analyze the entered email address for potential mistakes and then offer suggestions or automatically correct the errors. Some common typographical errors that an email typo fixer might address include:

1. Misspelled domain names: If the domain part of the email address (the part after the "@" symbol) is misspelled, the fixer may suggest the correct domain based on common domain names or known domains associated with the recipient's name or organization.

2. Reversed characters: The tool can detect situations where characters in the email address are accidentally reversed or swapped (e.g., "example@gmal.com" instead of "example@gmail.com").

3. Missing characters: In cases where characters are omitted from the email address (e.g., "example@gmailcom" instead of "example@gmail.com"), the fixer may recognize the pattern and offer the correct address.

4. Extra characters: If there are additional, unintended characters present (e.g., "example@@gmail.com" instead of "example@gmail.com"), the fixer can detect and remove or suggest removing the extra "@" symbol.
