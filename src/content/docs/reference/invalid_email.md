An email address without MX (Mail Exchange) records cannot receive emails because MX records are crucial components of the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration that specify the mail servers responsible for handling incoming emails for a particular domain.

When someone sends an email to an address, the sender's email server looks up the MX records of the recipient's domain to find the correct mail server responsible for handling emails for that domain. The MX records indicate the mail server's hostname or IP address to which the email should be delivered.

If a domain doesn't have any MX records or if the MX records are misconfigured or point to non-functional servers, the sending email server will have no way of knowing where to deliver the email. As a result, the email delivery will fail, and the sender will typically receive a bounce-back message indicating that the delivery was unsuccessful.

In other words, the absence of MX records effectively renders the domain incapable of receiving emails. Any attempt to send an email to an address associated with a domain lacking MX records will be unsuccessful, as there is no designated mail server to handle the incoming messages.

This situation is why an email address without MX records is unable to receive emails, and it is essential to ensure that the DNS configuration of a domain includes properly configured MX records if email communication is desired.
