The basic configuration let's you easily toggle checks on or off depending on how you want to use No550.

## Option

### Block throwaway emails

This option let's you block throwaway emails from being accepted to your service. We constantly work to identify throwaway services that pop up. This will only block throwaway services that we have verified, if you also wish to block services we have confidently identified but not verified yet you can also enable "[Block suspicious doamins](#block-suspicious-domains)".

If you find a throwaway service that is not blocked, please [contact us](https://no550.com/contact).

### Block fake emails

This option let's you block fake emails from being accepted to your service. These are emails which cannot be delivered to or are otherwise considered fake. This will only block fake emails that we have verified, if you also wish to block emails we have confidently identified but not verified yet you can also enable "[Block suspicious doamins](#block-suspicious-domains)".

### Block invalid emails

This option let's you block invalid emails from being accepted to your service. These are emails which are not considered valid per standards or service specific rules.

### Block suspicious domains

This option let's you block domains and emails which we have identified to be suspcicious. We have a automated detections in place that will flag this with confidence but we cannot say with 100% certainty that they will be invalid.

If you believe we have flagged something falsely please [contact us](https://no550.com/contact).
